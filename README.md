# Project-1
Project 1 of WDI-Remote: Backgammon in Browser Game

##Languages used: 
HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, jQuery

##Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Potential MVP
2 users, win condition(display winner), render board, detect peices, dice

**Strech Goals:** keeping score, double, animation

##Wireframe
May need to turn this into an image at some point. Until then here is a like to the PDF: https://github.com/Arcdeamonofire/project-1/blob/master/Planning/P1-Wireframe1.pdf

##Technologies Used (API Reference?)
jQuery: http://api.jquery.com/
jQueryUI: https://code.jquery.com/ui/

##Approach

Designed the HTML/CSS board first then Javascripted/jQueried the logic.
Next time I think I'll start with the script and make the game logically then work on getting it into the DOM. Might have been easier with arrays and objects rather than trying to get the DOM elements to manipulate correctly

##Installation Instructions

None :)

##Unsolved Problems

Oh plenty of bugs, 

right now 3 clicks are required to change turns even though two moves are taken.

on the win condition for white sometimes it can get extra moves I think this is connected to the above issue and the click counter reader.

still don't have blocks or bumps. Might be easy to add, but for now the mvp is reached so the stretch goals will be put off.
